Currently creating a Python script that can be published online for free so anyone can use it at any time.
I love listening to music and am always curious about the evolution of my music tastes. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
This app will (preferably) be ran on the last day of a given month, before UTC midnight. It will go through your Spotify library, adding tracks you've saved into a playlist (ex June 2024).
I would love to add this new playlist into a nested playlist, but Spotify API does not support that... yet, so it is up to you to organize the playlist.
If you miss a month are are curious about a specific month, you can hard code the date and the program will work just fine. This will be on line 14-16

Currently, the script can only be ran locally as I am having trouble integrating Flask. I'm still learning.
