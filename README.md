Currently creating a Python script that can be published online for free so anyone can use it at any time.
I love listening to music and am always curious about the evolution of my music tastes. Where did I come from? Where am I going?

Spotify Monthly Playlist looks at your entire saved library for songs saved in a month 
This application (app.py) uses Flask so that it may be web based. Currently, it is being hosted on pythonanywhere.com.
Still in development mode by Spotify, only select users can use the web application until it is approved and published. In the mean time, the bare bones script can still be ran locally (spotifymonthlyplaylist.py).

I created a folder to store all the months so that my playlist sections are organized. Unfortunantly, spotify doesn't have an API for that, so this must be done manually.
